                <h1>Quiet Corners in SAIT</h1>
                <p>There are many places to study on campus at <abbr title="Southern Alberta Institute of Technology">SAIT</abbr>,
                however sometimes those are unavailble due to many circumstances such as being full, loud, and too much traffic.Everyone have different preferences when it comes to finding the right place to study at, but majority of the time people look for places that is just right to study at. Here I will be listing three different places on SAIT campus that provide silence, no foot traffic and less people for less distractions.</p>

                <h2>Johnson-Cobbe Energy Centre</h2>
                <img src="images/Johnson-Cobbe-Energy-Centre-Study-Booth-Right.jpg" width="400" height="auto" alt="Study booths in the second floor of Johnson-Cobbe Energy Centre">
                <p>This study booth is located at the Johnson-Cobbe Energy Centre on SAIT Campus. The most notable feature of this building is the egg shaped dome at the top which makes it easier to distinguish between other buildings on the campus. Inside there are many places to study at, however the best place to study at this building is on the second floor by taking a right and heading straight after taking the escalator to the second floor. There are enough study booths to fit in a number of students, however due to it being on the more inside of the building there is less foot traffic and less people looking for this place which makes it the best quiet and distrationless study space. </p>
                <h2>Stand Grad Centre</h2>
                <img src="images/Stan-Grad-Centre-Study-Booth-right.jpg" width="400" height="auto" alt="Study booth in the second floor of the Stan Grad Centre near MB classrooms">
                <p>The study booths in the Stan Grad Centre are on the second floor near the MB classrooms. while away from the main lobby, it is still open enough to be able to pick up on the sound from the lobby. Aside from the fact that the general sounds form the main lobby can be heard from the study booths, it is also not too much to be distracting. The booths also come with charging ports and natural lighting from the windows beside it creating the perfect study space. There is not too much foot traffic, which only increases during the start of a class, or the end of a class. The distraction levels at these study booths is more compared to Johnson-Cobbe Energy Centre, however it is one of the nicer study areas with a relatively close access to the Jugo Juice on the first floor.</p>
                <h2>John Ware Building</h2>
                <img src="images/" width="400" height="auto" alt="Study area quiet booth in the John Ware Building">
                <p>The new study area in the John Ware Building is not packed or have too much foot traffic to be distracting. It is also close to the cafeteria in the John Ware Building which makes it perfect for any students who want to get food after long studying sessions. The area is completely quiet and also contains quiet booths which block out good amounts of sound from outside and from inside the quiet booths. Inside the booths there are charging ports for plugging in an outlet and even just plugging in a cable. There are also screen in the quiet booths that allow students to control the lights in the booths and even the air flow.</p>

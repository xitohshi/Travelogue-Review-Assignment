            <h1>Quiet Corners in SAIT</h1>
            <p>There are many places to study on campus at SAIT,
                however sometimes those are unavailble due to many circumstances such as being full, loud, and too much traffic.Everyone have different preferences when it comes to finding the right place to study at, but majority of the time people look for places that is just right to study at. Here I will be listing three different places on SAIT campus that provide silence, no foot traffic and less people for less distractions.</p>
